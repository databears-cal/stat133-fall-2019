## 1. The Big Picture

- :card_index: __Dates__: Aug-30, Sep-04
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: Let's start with an unconventional introduction to _computing with data_ using my favorite analogy "Data Analysis is a lot like Cooking". At the conceptual level we'll identify the main stages of the data analysis cycle. Also, we should keep in mind that data analysis projects usually start with a Research Question. In addition, we'll describe how Data can actually be seen from a triangular perspective (i.e. my "3 Views of Data").

## 2. R Survival Skills

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 04-05, :warning: _mostly in lab_
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: In addition to the "Big Picture" concepts, you'll begin learning basic survival skills for R. The main idea is to get a first contact with the RStudio workspace, and the Markdown syntax.

## 3. Intro to Data Technologies: Data Types, and Data Objects.

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 06-11
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: How do programming languages and computing environments handle data? To answer this question we'll discuss a couple of fundamental topics such as _data types_ and their implementation in R around _vectors_ and _arrays_. More specifically, we'll focus on concepts like atomicity, vectorization, recycling, and subsetting. Likewise, we will also describe more generic data objects such as lists.

## 4. Intro to Data Technologies (cont'd): Data Frames

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 11-12, :warning: _mostly in lab_
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: Besides atomic data objects, we also need to talk about R data frames which provide a nice structure to handle tabular data. You will learn how to manipulate data frames from two approaches: 1) using classic bracket notation, and 2) using a more modern and syntactic way following the _data plying_ framework provided by the package `"dplyr"`.

## 5. Housekeeping: Filesystem and Bash Commands

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 13-16
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: At the lowest level, Data Analysis Projects (DAPs) are essentially made of files and directories. Therefore, we need to review some fundamental concepts such as the file-system, the command line interface, and some basic shell commands.

## 6. Data Tables: Storage, Organization, Importing, and Unix filters

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 18-25
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: We continue with a fundamental topic of data technologies: _Data Tables_, the most common form in which data is stored, handled, and manipulated. Because datasets in tabular format are so ubiquitous, we need to talk about how tables are typically stored, learn good principles of data organization, and the so-called notion of "tidy data". You will also learn how to perform basic manipulation of data-table files with some unix filters. Also, we'll examine the relationship between tables and R data frames, as well as some considerations when importing (and exporting) tables in R.

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 30, Oct-09
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: Paraphrasing the old saying "a graphic is word a thousand numbers". No other means of data representation allows us to understand data than visual displays. But in order to make good graphics we need to learn the fundamental concepts for data visualization.

- :card_index: __Dates__: Oct 21-25
- :speech_balloon: __Topics__: In addition to writing functions to reduce duplication in your code, you also need to learn about iteration, which helps you when you need to do the same operation several times. Namely, we review control flow structures such as `for` loops, `while` loops, `repeat` loops, and the `apply` family functions.

## 13. More Shiny Apps and Introduction to Regular Expressions

- :card_index: __Dates__: Nov 04-08
- :speech_balloon:  __Topics__: Random numbers have many applications in science and computer programming, especially when there are significant uncertainties in a phenomenon of interest. In this part of the course we'll look at some basic problems involving working with random numbers and creating simulations. Additionally, we continue the discussion about character strings with a first contact to Regular Expressions.

## 14. More Regular Expressions

- :card_index: __Dates__: Nov 11-15
- :speech_balloon:  __Topics__: At its heart, computing involves working with numbers. However, a considerable amount of information and data is in the form of text. To unleash the power of strings manipulation, we need to take things to the next level and learn about Regular Expressions. Namely, Regular expressions are a tool that allows us to describe a certain amount of text called "patterns". We'll describe the basic concepts of regex and the common operations to match text patterns.
